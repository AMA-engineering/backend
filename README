--------- A MILLION ADS TECH TEST ---------

This is a simple skeleton to an api dealing with data on postcode inputs. 
We've provided this knowing your time is precious, and we strongly suggest that you use this as your starting point, and complete as much as you can within the agreed time limit. 
However you may set up the project differently and/or use a different language or framework if that helps to display your skills better.

The main task is to convert inputted postcode(s) to latlons. 
For your convenience see http://postcodes.io/ (again not required to use).
The requirements of this task are vague and we are interested to see what you come up with in a timeframe of two hours.
Please be prepared to speak about your work in a follow-up interview. 
We want to hear your decisions on the work you have done, what you would have added if it weren't for the time constraint etc.

Please feel free to ask as many questions as you would like about the task. Good luck!
